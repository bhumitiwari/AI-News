## 🧠 Approach
The project follows a clean separation between frontend and backend, using the Gemini API to generate AI summaries. Here's how it works:

### 1.Frontend (Client)
Built using React, Vite, TypeScript, and Mantine UI. It presents a user-friendly interface for reading AI-generated news summaries and an admin panel for managing articles.

### 2.Backend (Server)
Built with Node.js and Express. It receives article content from the frontend and communicates with the Gemini API to generate summaries.

### 3.Gemini API Integration
The backend sends the article content to the Gemini API using a prompt, receives an AI-generated summary, and sends it back to the frontend to display to users.
